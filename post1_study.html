                    <h2 class="section-heading">My Inital Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>It’s finally happening! The moment I have been waiting for since I was five years old! I am finally embarking on my journey to the great country of Japan. I have been enthralled with Japanese society and culture ever since I watched my first episode of Pokémon – and before you ask yes I still play Pokémon (it is the best game ever made). Moreover, I have always been fascinated with societies vastly different than my own. As a first-generation Ghanaian-American, I am well aware that cultures, although they appear to be similar, can be vastly different and even conflicting. </p><p>I had to struggle with this fact growing up in America coupled with overcoming identity issues (I think all expats, immigrants, and first-generation people had to deal with this). But by having two unique cultures, I have become a more thoroughly well rounded person. I now appreciate many cultures, and I am more open, compared to most Americans (especially those who haven’t traveled), on different customs, views, and interactions in life. </p>

                    <p>Because of this, I thought that going to Japan (which is vastly different than Ghana, America, or European nations that I have visited), would allow me to grow and see the world in a wider context. There is always room to develop one’s idiosyncratic and empathic facilities and through the course of traveling, a person can definitely expand on these characteristics. Being in Japan will be enjoyable most of the time, and sometimes it may be melancholic. However, I am certain that this experience will definitely become one of the hallmarks of my college experience. </p>

                    <p>Maybe this experience will give me more clarity on what I want to accomplish in the next five years (I’m still debating about becoming a Data Scientist or getting my PhD in Computer Science). Hopefully this is the case, my parents keep inquiring about my future (shoot I don’t even know what anime series I want to watch tonight: there are so many good choices!) Anyway, I digress.</p>

                    <p>Thankfully, I will be going with three likeminded goofballs that I am glad to call my good friends (hopefully we don’t do anything too crazy while we are there). This should make the transition to Japanese society a little smoother and a lot more delightful. </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Wrapping Up</h2>

                    <p>And with that said, Kwansei Gakuin University and Japan here I come! I will try my best to write about the food, culture, highlights, lowlights, surprises, etc. at least once a week. So stay tuned! </p>

                    <p>“We can’t live if we don’t keep running forward” – Natsu Dragneel</p>

                    <p>
                    You heard it from the Dragon Slayer himself! We can’t live without pressing onwards. So with this in mind, try a new activity this week! Who knows, you may discover a new perspective that may lend well to your day-to-day activities. Or you may find a new hobby! 
                    </p>

                    
                    <p>Until next time friends. じゃあ、またね
